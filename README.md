# My Personal Website

Run `npm start` in the outermost directory to spin up this app. It's a boostrapped React web application hosted on AWS Amplify (which I highly recommend for fullstack serverless web apps with continuous deployment). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
